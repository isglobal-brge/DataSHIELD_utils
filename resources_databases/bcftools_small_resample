Workflow:
1) Subset .vcf.gz file by the first 10k SNPs
bcftools query -f '%ID\n' my_vcf | head -10000 > ids.txt
bcftools view -i "ID=@ids.txt" my_other_vcf

2) Subset the small vcf into two new vcf files by samples (simulate two cohorts)
bcftools view -S samples1.txt file.vcf > filtered1.vcf
bcftools view -S samples2.txt file.vcf > filtered2.vcf

3) Compress resulting vcf files
bgzip -c filtered1.vcf > filtered1.vcf.gz

File structure:
  - From files chrX.vcf.gz
  - Create:
    - chrX_samplesA_small.vcf.gz
    - chrX_samplesB_small.vcf.gz
